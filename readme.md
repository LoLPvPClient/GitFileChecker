# GitFileCheck

This repository was created for the purpose of developing a python package that will check the file first when a user wants to commit something to git to validate if everything is okay, If something's fail, the commit will be cancelled.

Currently, it only checks for the `Docstring` and currently the package is under development at the moment.
